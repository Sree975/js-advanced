Q3. What will be the output of the following code?
var Employee =
{
company: 'Rohit'
}
var Emp1 = Object.create(employee);
delete Emp1.company Console.log(emp1.company)
  
ANSWER
it shows error and gives no output.  The type of error is Reference error. Javascript is case sensitive. The first letter
of name of the variable should be small but the given code does not follows it. The first letter of console c should
be capital. On correcting all these mistakes we get output Rohit
