Q5.
var arr = [2, 56, 78, 34, 65];
var new_arr = arr.map(function(num) {
return num / 2;
});
print(new_arr);
What will be the output for the above code?
 ANSWER
     the given code is wrong in javascript for printing we have to use console.log.  On using correct statement
the output is an array[1,28,39,17,31.5] which is given by dividing the given array by 2.
